# Filmetrics-Analysis
Use Python to analyze filmetrics data to see how clean the data is 
The first step is to enter the data into a CVS file, with the number of the wafer, position of the wafer, thickness of the wafer, index of refraction, and goodness of fit. After changing the URL to ensure the correct file is accessed, the program will clean out the data and show when the index of refraction is out of range and not possible if not a metamaterial. After cleaning the data, the mean, standard deviation, and plotting the data of the thickness, index of refraction, and goodness of fit.
